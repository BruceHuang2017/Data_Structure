find all nodes

generate dictionary for "each_nodes : connected nodes". parents found.

then solve Q1 and Q2 by using parents dictionary.

use shorest_path_in_graph to find shortest path for each node towards given node. 

use the generated shortest_path_in_graph dictionary, can calcualte the steps to get the target node. 

then solve Q3.

re-arrenge 'spig' dictionary to get max_path_in_graph.
